# MDApp Widget – GitHub Pages

This repo hosts the MDApp widget as a simple web page you can share. It’s suitable for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
1. **Create a new GitHub repo** (e.g., `mdapp-widget`).
2. Upload the files from this folder (`index.html` and `README.md`) to the **root** of the repo.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`) / `/ (root)`
4. Save. GitHub will build the site. After 1–3 minutes, your site will be live at:
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Local test
Open `index.html` in a browser. It must be online to fetch the MDApp SDK.

## Optional: install as an app
Open the live site in Chrome or Edge → menu → **Install this site as an app** (or **Create shortcut → Open as window**).
